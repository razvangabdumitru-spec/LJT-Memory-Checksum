# Memory Checksum Audit: memory/memory.json

Repository: https://github.com/razvangabdumitru-spec/LJT-Memory-Checksum

NOTE: I could not locate or read the file memory/memory.json in the repository or the provided workspace during this audit. Because the user requested that the audit be based only on the contents of memory/memory.json and to not add any information not present there, every required section below is marked MISSING when the corresponding data cannot be read from that file. I have not invented or inferred any facts not present in the memory file.

---

1) Compact bio paragraph

MISSING — memory/memory.json not available. Cannot extract a compact bio paragraph because the source file could not be read.


2) Education / Research positions

The requested table listing every education/research position with inferred start/end dates cannot be produced because memory/memory.json was not accessible. Below is a placeholder table to show the expected format; all fields are MISSING.

| Position / Role | Organization | Start date (inferred) | End date (inferred) | Source snippet (exact) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| MISSING | MISSING | MISSING | MISSING | MISSING |

If memory/memory.json is provided, I will fill this table with one row per position and include exact quoted snippets from the memory for traceability.


3) Research interests (deduplicated, grouped into up to 3 themes)

MISSING — memory/memory.json not available. Cannot extract research interests or group them into themes without the source text.

Expected output when file is available (example structure):
- Theme A: interest 1, interest 2
- Theme B: interest 3, interest 4
- Theme C: interest 5


4) Publications

MISSING — memory/memory.json not available. Cannot determine whether publications are present. Because the memory file could not be read, I cannot assert "No publications found in memory." If you provide the file or its contents, I will list each publication with venue/year if available, otherwise explicitly state "No publications found in memory." as requested.


5) Anomalies & Uncertainties (conflicting or ambiguous snippets)

MISSING — memory/memory.json not available. Cannot quote or analyze conflicting/ambiguous snippets without access to the memory text. When memory/memory.json is provided, I will:
- Quote the exact conflicting/ambiguous snippets verbatim.
- For each quoted snippet, explain exactly why it is ambiguous or conflicting (e.g., contradictory dates, vague role titles, missing context), without guessing missing facts.

If you want this audit completed, please add memory/memory.json to the repository at path memory/memory.json, or provide the file contents. I will then re-run the audit and populate all sections strictly from that file without adding external information.
